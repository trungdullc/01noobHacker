## Goal
The 247/CTF Discord server is a place to discuss CTF challenges, problems and ideas with a like minded community. You can join the 247/CTF Discord server via the following link.

Once you join the server, you can link your 247CTF account with Discord by sending a direct message to the 247CTF-BOT. You can view your Discord link code in your 247CTF profile (click the 'EDIT PROFILE' button). Once you link your accounts, the Discord bot will give you a flag!
