## Goal
At the 247/CTF, challenges are not shared with multiple players and VPNs are not required. Instead, you have the control to start and stop your own unique challenge instance at any time. Once you have launched a challenge, you can access the instance by clicking on the pop up which loads in the bottom right hand corner of every page.<br>

Click the ‚ÄòSTART CHALLENGE‚Äô button to the right of this text description to start a web challenge. Once the challenge instance is launched, click on the pop up on the bottom right hand corner containing the challenge name to access the web application and submit the flag!
