# Trebek Level 02 ‚Üí 03 Get-WinEvent -Path .\security.evtx -FilterXPath "*[System[(EventID=4624)]] and *[EventData[Data[@Name='TargetUserName'] and (Data='Yoda')]]"

## Previous Flag

```

## Goal
The password for trebek4 is the IP that the user Yoda last logged in from as depicted in the event logs on the desktop PLUS the name of the text file on the user‚Äôs desktop.<br>

NOTE: If the IP address is ‚Äú2.3.3.2‚Äù and the file on the desktop is named ‚Äúbobby‚Äù, the password would be ‚Äú2.3.3.2bobby‚Äù

## What I learned
```
Get-WinEvent -Path .\security.evtx -FilterXPath "*[System[(EventID=4624)]] and *[EventData[Data[@Name='TargetUserName'] and (Data='Yoda')]]"
```
