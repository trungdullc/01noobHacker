## Previous Flag
```
N/A
```

## Goal
Instructions located in the README file in each levels home directory<br>
Passwords are stored in /pass<br>
Use /code as /tmp<br>
Telnet to blowfish.smashthestack.org port 6666 to recieve an encrypted passwd.<br>
Decrypt it and log in to level2<br><br>
ssh -l level2 blowfish.smashthestack.org -p 2222

## What I learned
```
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -l level2 blowfish.smashthestack.org -p 2222
ROT13
```

## Solution
