# Bandit Level 4 → Level 5

## Previous Flag
<b>4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw</b>

## Goal
Use previous password to log in SSH with user <b>bandit5</b> on port <b>2220</b>.  Password stored in a file somewhere <b>under inhere directory</b> and has all of the following properties:
```
human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable
```

## What I learned
```
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ apropos find
find (1)    - search for files in a directory hierarchy

find ./ -type f     Search for regular files
-size 1033c         Find files 1033 bytes (c for bytes)
! -executable       files executable files
-exec file {} \;    Print file type using file cmd
```

## Solution
```
@trungdullc ➜ /workspaces/01noobHacker (main) $ ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
bandit5@bandit:~$ whatis find
find (1)    - search for files in a directory hierarchy
bandit5@bandit:~$ ls

bandit5@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls

bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find ./ -type f -size 1033c -exec file {} \; | grep "ASCII"
./maybehere07/.file2: ASCII text, with very long lines (1000)
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./maybehere07/.file2
