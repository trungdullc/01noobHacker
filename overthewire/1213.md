# Bandit Level 12 â†’ Level 13

## Previous Flag
<b>FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn</b>

## Goal
Use previous password to log in SSH with user <b>bandit13</b> on port <b>2220</b>.  Password stored in <b>/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14</b> and <b>can only be read by user bandit14</b>. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a <b>private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level<b>. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

## What I learned
```
If many users on same computer can use localhost(127.0.0.1) to do a nested ssh
Enter ssh w/o password just need private key
```

## Solution
```

               Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read.  You can also specify a public key file to use the corresponding private key that is loaded  in  ssh-agent(1) when the private key  file is not present locally.  The default is  ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk and ~/.ssh/id_dsa.
