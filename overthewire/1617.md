# Bandit Level 16 → Level 17

## Previous Flag
N/A logged in with private RSA

## Goal
Use private RSA to log in with user <b>bandit17</b> on port <b>2220</b>.  There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The <b>password for the next level is in passwords.new</b> and is the <b>only line that has been changed</b> between passwords.old and passwords.new

NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19

## What I learned
```

```

## Solution
```
bandit17@bandit:~$ ls
passwords.new  passwords.old
bandit17@bandit:~$ whatis cat grep ls diff
cat (1)              - concatenate files and print on the standard output
grep (1)             - print lines that match patterns
ls (1)               - list directory contents
diff (1)             - compare files line by line
bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.new passwords.old

bandit17@bandit:~$ cat passwords.new | grep x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
bandit17@bandit:~$ man grep | grep "invert-match"
       -v, --invert-match
              --invert-match option (see above), count non-matching lines.
              NUM.  When the -v or --invert-match option is also used, grep stops after outputting NUM non-matching lines.
bandit17@bandit:~$ grep -f passwords.old --invert-match passwords.new
