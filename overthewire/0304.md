# Bandit Level 3 → Level 4

## Previous Flag
<b>2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ</b>

## Goal
Use previous password to log in SSH with user <b>bandit4</b> on port <b>2220</b>.  Password for the next level is stored in the only <b>human-readable file</b> in <b>inhere directory</b>

## What I learned
```
Note: . is NOT wildcard in shell
* wildcard for more than 1
? wildcard for only 1
file to figure which file is human readable (!binary)
```

## Solution
```
