# picoGym Level 369: Ready Gladiator 1
Source: https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/369

## Goal
Can you make a CoreWars warrior that wins?<br>
Your opponent is the Imp. The source is available here.<br>
https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/410/imp.red<br>
If you wanted to pit the Imp against himself, you could download the Imp and connect to the CoreWars server like this:<br>
nc saturn.picoctf.net 50643 < imp.red<br>
To get the flag, you must beat the Imp at least once out of the many rounds.

17 instructions:
    DAT  data
    MOV  move
    ADD  add
    SUB  subtract
    MUL  multiply
    DIV  divide
    MOD  modula (remainder of division)
    JMP  jump
    JMZ  jump if zero
    JMN  jump if not zero
    DJN  decrement, jump if not zero
    SPL  split execution
    SLT  skip if less than
    CMP  compare (see SEQ)
    SEQ  skip if equal

Name:           Imp Gate
Speed:          None
Size:           1
Durability:     Strong
Effectiveness:  Excellent against imps, Extremely Poor against others
Score:

gate equ wait-10 üëÄ
wait JMP wait,<gate üëÄ
end wait üëÄ

Imp Gate waits and destroys imps that happen to pass 10 instructions before it. It is seldom overrun by imps and its small size makes it difficult to locate. The imp gate is defensive by nature, and will not win against a stationary enemy unless this enemy self-destructs.
