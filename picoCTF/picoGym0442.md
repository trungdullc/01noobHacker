# picoGym Level 0442: Binary Search
Source: https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/442

## Goal
Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You'll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.
Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics. Practicing the fundamentals manually might help you in the future when you have to write your own tools!<br>
ssh -p 56697 ctf-player@atlas.picoctf.net<br>
Using the password <b>6abf4a82</b>. Accept the fingerprint with yes, and ls once connected to begin. Remember, in a shell, passwords are hidden!

## What I learned
```
Setup shell to go directly into bash script and exit when done
    Modifying SSH configuration with ForceCommand in sshd_config
    Setting user's shell to a script in /etc/passwd
    Using wrappers or specific configuration files/.bash_profile or /.ssh/rc

binary-search.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
exec /opt/game/binary-search                    # exec replaces the shell; no shell remains

# Make it executable and not writable by any user
sudo chown root:root /opt/game/binary-search /opt/game/binary-search.sh
sudo chmod 755 /opt/game/binary-search /opt/game/binary-search.sh

# Method 1: ForceCommand in sshd_config (clean + hard to bypass)
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Match User ctf-player
    ForceCommand /opt/game/binary-search.sh üëÄ
    PermitTTY yes üëÄ                                # if game needs interactive input
    AllowTcpForwarding no
    X11Forwarding no
    PermitTunnel no

sudo systemctl reload sshd                          # ssh
# Now any SSH login as ctf-player runs /opt/game/binary-search.sh

# Method 2: Use profile scripts (Weaker, easier to bypass)
echo 'exec /opt/game/binary-search' >> ~ctf-player/.bash_profile
```
