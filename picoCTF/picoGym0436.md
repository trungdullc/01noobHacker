## Goal
The Multiverse is within your grasp! Unfortunately, the server that contains the secrets of the multiverse is in a universe where keyboards only have numbers and (most) symbols.<br>
sh -p 57647 ctf-player@mimas.picoctf.net<br>
Use password: 6abf4a82

## What I learned
```
Was trying to get to
  /usr/bin/cat
  /usr/bin/echo
  /usr/bin/base64                           # Was most stable option
# Navigate System by wildcards and numbers
```
