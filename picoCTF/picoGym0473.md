## What I learned
```
ChatGPT: An Affine Cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher in classical cryptography.
It‚Äôs based on simple math using modular arithmetic. Think of it as a combination of a multiplicative cipher and an additive (Caesar) cipher.

Note: Dynamic answer each time
Note: Can decode message if know A and B

***    The Mystery of the CLONED RAT    ***
*******************************************

The super evil Dr. Lacktoes Inn Tolerant told me he kidnapped my best friend, Squeexy, and replaced him with an evil clone! You look JUST LIKE SQUEEXY, but I'm not sure if you're him or THE CLONE. I've devised a plan to find out if YOU'RE the REAL SQUEEXY! If you're Squeexy, I'll give you the key to the cloning room so you can maul the imposter...

Here's my secret cheese -- if you're Squeexy, you'll be able to guess it:  GXSZZQITNLZ üëÄ
Hint: The cheeses are top secret and limited edition, so they might look different from cheeses you're used to!

Here's your encrypted cheese:  ORKZZSX üëÄ
Not sure why you want it though...*squeak* - oh well!

I don't wanna talk to you too much if you're some suspicious character and not my BFF Squeexy!
You have 2 more chances to prove yourself to me!
