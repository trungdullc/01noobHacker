# picoGym Level 472: Flag Hunters
Source: https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/472

## Goal
Lyrics jump from verses to the refrain kind of like a subroutine call. There's a hidden refrain this program doesn't print by default.<br>
Can you get it to print it? There might be something in it for you.<br>
The program's source code can be downloaded here.<br>

Connect to the program with netcat:<br>
$ nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 57753

## What I learned
```
Reverse Engineering: Python3
Step 1: Write comments in other peoples code to understand it
```

## Side Quest

[REFRAIN]
We‚Äôre flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,
We‚Äôre chasing that victory, and we‚Äôll never quit.
CROWD (Singalong here!);
RETURN

[VERSE1]
Command line wizards, we‚Äôre starting it right,
Spawning shells in the terminal, hacking all night.
Scripts and searches, grep through the void,
Every keystroke, we're a cypher's envoy.
Brute force the lock or craft that regex,
Flag on the horizon, what challenge is next?

REFRAIN;

Echoes in memory, packets in trace,
Digging through the remnants to uncover with haste.
Hex and headers, carving out clues,
Resurrect the hidden, it's forensics we choose.
Disk dumps and packet dumps, follow the trail,
Buried deep in the noise, but we will prevail.

REFRAIN;

Binary sorcerers, let‚Äôs tear it apart,
Disassemble the code to reveal the dark heart.
From opcode to logic, tracing each line,
Emulate and break it, this key will be mine.
Debugging the maze, and I see through the deceit,
Patch it up right, and watch the lock release.

REFRAIN;

Ciphertext tumbling, breaking the spin,
Feistel or AES, we‚Äôre destined to win.
Frequency, padding, primes on the run,
Vigen√®re, RSA, cracking them for fun.
Shift the letters, matrices fall,
Decrypt that flag and hear the ether call.

REFRAIN;

SQL injection, XSS flow,
Map the backend out, let the database show.
Inspecting each cookie, fiddler in the fight,
Capturing requests, push the payload just right.
HTML's secrets, backdoors unlocked,
In the world wide labyrinth, we‚Äôre never lost.

REFRAIN;

Stack's overflowing, breaking the chain,
ROP gadget wizardry, ride it to fame.
Heap spray in silence, memory's plight,
Race the condition, crash it just right.
Shellcode ready, smashing the frame,
Control the instruction, flags call my name.
