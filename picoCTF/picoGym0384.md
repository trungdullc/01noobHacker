# picoGym Level 0384: useless
Source: https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/384

## Goal
There's an interesting script in the user's home directory<br>
The work computer is running SSH. We've been given a script which performs some basic calculations, explore the script and find a flag.<br>
Hostname: saturn.picoctf.net<br>
Port:     65288<br>
