# picoGym Level 7: vault-door-training
Source: https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/7

## Goal
Your mission is to enter Dr. Evil's laboratory and retrieve the blueprints for his Doomsday Project.<br>
The laboratory is protected by a series of locked vault doors. Each door is controlled by a computer and requires a password to open.<br> Unfortunately, our undercover agents have not been able to obtain the secret passwords for the vault doors, but one of our junior agents obtained the source code for each vault's computer!<br>
You will need to read the source code for each level to figure out what the password is for that vault door.<br>
As a warmup, we have created a replica vault in our training facility.<br>
The source code for the training vault is here: VaultDoorTraining.java<br>
